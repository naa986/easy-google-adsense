== Description ==

[Easy Google AdSense](https://noorsplugin.com/easy-google-adsense-plugin-wordpress/) plugin makes Google AdSense monetization easier for WordPress. With this plugin, there is no need to manually add AdSense ads/code to different parts of your website. You just enter your Google AdSense Publisher ID in the settings and Google will automatically start showing ads at optimal times when they are likely to perform well for your website and provide a good experience for your users.

=== What is Google AdSense Auto Ads? === 

Auto Ads is an improved monetization method in Google AdSense. It uses machine learning to make smart ad placement for your website. When this is enabled, Google will analyze your site and show ads only when it thinks they will perform well and provide a good user experience.

* There is no conflict since it takes into consideration any ad code that you have already placed on your website
* It works with page-level ads since page-level ads have been migrated into auto ads
